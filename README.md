# 2DClinostat
A clinostat is a device that removes the effect of gravity on plant root and shoot growth, effectively simulating a weightless environment without the need to leave Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
### Design Considerations
The 2D clinostat must...
- Rotate at a continuous speed of 1 RPM for a week
- Use a single step motor to drive the rotation
- Hold a minimum of 4 petri dishes
- Reuse as many materials as possible

Additional Considerations
- Should be robust enough to everyday wear and tear
- Must minimize as many outside stimuli as possible including vibration and light exposure
- Should be easy to operate
- Should be as compact and simple as possible 
### Future Work
Focus for this semester
- Make the clinostat more durable by building the frame out of non-rusting, non-hygroscopic materials such as stainless steel.
- Minimize vibration on the petri dishes from the stepper motor by 
remodeling the bearing adapters that connect the petri dish housing to the stepper motor and the frame.
Beyond this semester
- Add a UI LCD screen and potentiometer to control the rotation speed and run time of the 2D clinostat
- Housing for electrical components to conserve space and have a cleaner look
- Build an enclosing device with a lighting system to control the amount of light that the plants are exposed to during experiments.
